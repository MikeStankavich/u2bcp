multivalue Y/N


odds n ends
multivalue mapped as single behavior - default to concat separated by \n, or truncate
sqlize column names by replacing non \w chars with _ and trimming any leading, append seq # to resolve dups
may be able to formulate type from U2 format code
default type is varchar(8000)
no idea on encoding maybe 8859? defer for now
can we create table from SV and MV indicators?
We should allow MV groupings, I.E M1 = 1st group, M2 = 2nd group. This allows case where
multiple sub tables live in same file. 



ok here we go mini sprint style
do i need wrapper object for connections or just use natives?
figure out a properties file so dont have to string out all details on command line
figure out how to specify and store column mapping
